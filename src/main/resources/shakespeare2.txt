Henry V. Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand
to laugh a little. Edward Poins. Where hast been, Hal? Henry V. With three
or four loggerheads amongst three or four score hogsheads. I have sounded
the very base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash
of drawers; and can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick,
and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation, that though I be
but the prince of Wales, yet I am king of courtesy; and tell me flatly
I am no proud Jack, like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a
good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I am king of England,
I shall command all the good lads in Eastchea::qp. They call drinking deep,
dyeing scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they cry 'hem!'
and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one
quarter of an hour, that I can drink with any tinker in his own language
during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour, that thou
wert not with me in this sweet action. But, sweet Ned,—to sweeten which
name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into
my hand by an under-skinker, one that never spake other English in his
life than 'Eight shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with this
shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-Moon,'
or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,
do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my puny drawer to what
end he gave me the sugar; and do thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that
his tale to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and I'll show thee
a precedent. Edward Poins. Francis! Henry V. Thou art perfect. Edward Poins.
Francis! [Exit POINS] [Enter FRANCIS] Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Look down
into the Pomgarnet, Ralph. Henry V. Come hither, Francis. Francis. My lord?
Henry V. How long hast thou to serve, Francis? Francis. Forsooth, five
years, and as much as to— Edward Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon,
anon, sir. Henry V. Five year! by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking
of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant as to play the coward
with thy indenture and show it a fair pair of heels and run from it? Francis.
O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in England, I could find
in my heart. Edward Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Henry
V. How old art thou, Francis? Francis. Let me see—about Michaelmas next
I shall be— Edward Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Pray stay
a little, my lord. Henry V. Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou
gavest me,'twas a pennyworth, wast't not? Francis. O Lord, I would it had
been two! Henry V. I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me when
thou wilt, and thou shalt have it. Edward Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis.
Anon, anon. Henry V. Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis;
or, Francis, o' Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But, Francis!
Francis. My lord? Henry V. Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button,
not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,—
Francis. O Lord, sir, who do you mean? Henry V. Why, then, your brown bastard
is your only drink; for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will
sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much. Francis. What, sir?
Edward Poins. [Within] Francis! Henry V. Away, you rogue! dost thou not
hear them call? [Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed, not
knowing which way to go] [Enter Vintner] Vintner. What, standest thou still,
and hearest such a calling? Look to the guests within. [Exit Francis] My
lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are at the door: shall I let
them in? Henry V. Let them alone awhile, and then open the door. [Exit
Vintner] Poins! [Re-enter POINS] Edward Poins. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V.
Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the door: shall we
be merry? Edward Poins. As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what
cunning match have you made with this jest of the drawer? come, what's
the issue? Henry V. I am now of all humours that have showed themselves
humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this present
twelve o'clock at midnight. [Re-enter FRANCIS] What's o'clock, Francis?
Francis. Anon, anon, sir. [Exit] Henry V. That ever this fellow should
have fewer words than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry
is upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I
am not yet of Percy's mind, the Hotspur of the north; he that kills me
some six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and
says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,'
says she, 'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan horse a drench,'
says he; and answers 'Some fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.'
I prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and that damned brawn shall
play Dame Mortimer his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call
in tallow. [Enter FALSTAFF, Gadshill, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following
with wine] Edward Poins. Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been? Falstaff.
A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too! marry, and amen! Give
me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks
and mend them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards! Give me a cup
of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant? [He drinks] Henry V. Didst thou
never see Titan kiss a dish of butter? pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted
at the sweet tale of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.
Falstaff. You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is nothing but
roguery to be found in villanous man: yet a coward is worse than a cup
of sack with lime in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack; die
when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of
the earth, then am I a shotten herring. There live not three good men unhanged
in England; and one of them is fat and grows old: God help the while! a
bad world, I say. I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any thing.
A plague of all cowards, I say still. Henry V. How now, wool-sack! what
mutter you? Falstaff. A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom
with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock
of wild-geese, I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!
Henry V. Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter? Falstaff. Are
not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there? Edward Poins. 'Zounds,
ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the Lord, I'll stab thee. Falstaff.
I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call thee coward: but I
would give a thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst. You are
straight enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back: call
you that backing of your friends? A plague upon such backing! give me them
that will face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I drunk to-day.
Henry V. O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last.
Falstaff. All's one for that. [He drinks] A plague of all cowards, still
say I. Henry V. What's the matter? Falstaff. What's the matter! there be
four of us here have ta'en a thousand pound this day morning. Henry V.
Where is it, Jack? where is it? Falstaff. Where is it! taken from us it
is: a hundred upon poor four of us. Henry V. What, a hundred, man? Falstaff.
I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two hours
together. I have 'scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through the
doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut through and through; my
sword hacked like a hand-saw—ecce signum! I never dealt better since I
was a man: all would not do. A plague of all cowards! Let them speak: if
they speak more or less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.
Henry V. Speak, sirs; how was it? Gadshill. We four set upon some dozen—
Falstaff. Sixteen at least, my lord. Gadshill. And bound them. Peto. No,
no, they were not bound. Falstaff. You rogue, they were bound, every man
of them; or I am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew. Gadshill. As we were sharing,
some six or seven fresh men set upon us— Falstaff. And unbound the rest,
and then come in the other. Henry V. What, fought you with them all? Falstaff.
All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought not with fifty of them,
I am a bunch of radish: if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor
old Jack, then am I no two-legged creature. Henry V. Pray God you have
not murdered some of them. Falstaff. Nay, that's past praying for: I have
peppered two of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram
suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call
me horse. Thou knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my point.
Four rogues in buckram let drive at me— Henry V. What, four? thou saidst
but two even now. Falstaff. Four, Hal; I told thee four. Edward Poins.
Ay, ay, he said four. Falstaff. These four came all a-front, and mainly
thrust at me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven points in
my target, thus. Henry V. Seven? why, there were but four even now. Falstaff.
In buckram? Edward Poins. Ay, four, in buckram suits. Falstaff. Seven,
by these hilts, or I am a villain else. Henry V. Prithee, let him alone;
we shall have more anon. Falstaff. Dost thou hear me, Hal? Henry V. Ay,
and mark thee too, Jack. Falstaff. Do so, for it is worth the listening
to. These nine in buckram that I told thee of— Henry V. So, two more already.
Falstaff. Their points being broken,— Edward Poins. Down fell their hose.
Falstaff. Began to give me ground: but I followed me close, came in foot
and hand; and with a thought seven of the eleven I paid. Henry V. O monstrous!
eleven buckram men grown out of two! Falstaff. But, as the devil would
have it, three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let
drive at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand.
Henry V. These lies are like their father that begets them; gross as a
mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated
fool, thou whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,— Falstaff. What, art
thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth the truth? Henry V. Why, how couldst
thou know these men in Kendal green, when it was so dark thou couldst not
see thy hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this? Edward
Poins. Come, your reason, Jack, your reason. Falstaff. What, upon compulsion?
'Zounds, an I were at the strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion! If reasons
were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion,
I. Henry V. I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine coward,
this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker, this huge hill of flesh,— Falstaff.
'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried neat's tongue, you bull's
pizzle, you stock-fish! O for breath to utter what is like thee! you tailor's-yard,
you sheath, you bowcase; you vile standing-tuck,— Henry V. Well, breathe
awhile, and then to it again: and when thou hast tired thyself in base
comparisons, hear me speak but this. Edward Poins. Mark, Jack. Henry V.
We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and were masters of their
wealth. Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down. Then did we two
set on you four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your prize, and have
it; yea, and can show it you here in the house: and, Falstaff, you carried
your guts away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy
and still run and roared, as ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou,
to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight! What
trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst thou now find out to hide
thee from this open and apparent shame? Edward Poins. Come, let's hear,
Jack; what trick hast thou now? Falstaff. By the Lord, I knew ye as well
as he that made ye. Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince? why, thou knowest I
am as valiant as Hercules: but beware instinct; the lion will not touch
the true prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a coward on instinct.
I shall think the better of myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you
have the money. Hostess, clap to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship
come to you! What, shall we be merry? shall we have a play extempore? Henry
V. Content; and the argument shall be thy running away. Falstaff. Ah, no
more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me! [Enter Hostess] Hostess Quickly.
O Jesu, my lord the prince! Henry V. How now, my lady the hostess! what
sayest thou to me? Hostess Quickly. Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman
of the court at door would speak with you: he says he comes from your father.
Henry V. Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him back
again to my mother. Falstaff. What manner of man is he? Hostess Quickly.
An old man. Falstaff. What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
I give him his answer? Henry V. Prithee, do, Jack. Falstaff. 'Faith, and
I'll send him packing. [Exit FALSTAFF] Henry V. Now, sirs: by'r lady, you
fought fair; so did you, Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too,
you ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true prince; no, fie!
Lord Bardolph. 'Faith, I ran when I saw others run. Henry V. 'Faith, tell
me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's sword so hacked? Peto. Why, he hacked
it with his dagger, and said he would swear truth out of England but he
would make you believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the
like. Lord Bardolph. Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to make
them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was
the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
to hear his monstrous devices. Henry V. O villain, thou stolest a cup of
sack eighteen years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and
yet thou rannest away: what instinct hadst thou for it? Lord Bardolph.
My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold these exhalations? Henry
V. I do. Lord Bardolph. What think you they portend? Henry V. Hot livers
and cold purses. Lord Bardolph. Choler, my lord, if rightly taken. Henry
V. No, if rightly taken, halter. [Re-enter FALSTAFF] Here comes lean Jack,
here comes bare-bone. How now, my sweet creature of bombast! How long is't
ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee? Falstaff. My own knee! when
I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle's talon in the waist; I
could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of sighing and
grief! it blows a man up like a bladder. There's villanous news abroad:
here was Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the court in the
morning. That same mad fellow of the north, Percy, and he of Wales, that
gave Amamon the bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the devil
his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook—what a plague call you
him? Edward Poins. O, Glendower. Falstaff. Owen, Owen, the same; and his
son-in-law Mortimer, and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill perpendicular,— Henry
V. He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying.
Falstaff. You have hit it. Henry V. So did he never the sparrow. Falstaff.
Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run. Henry V. Why,
what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for running! Falstaff. O'
horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot. Henry V. Yes,
Jack, upon instinct. Falstaff. I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there
too, and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more: Worcester is stolen
away to-night; thy father's beard is turned white with the news: you may
buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel. Henry V. Why, then, it is like,
if there come a hot June and this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds. Falstaff. By the mass, lad, thou
sayest true; it is like we shall have good trading that way. But tell me,
Hal, art not thou horrible afeard? thou being heir-apparent, could the
world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid? doth
not thy blood thrill at it? Henry V. Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some
of thy instinct. Falstaff. Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when
thou comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer. Henry V.
Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the particulars of my
life. Falstaff. Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state, this dagger
my sceptre, and this cushion my crown. Henry V. Thy state is taken for
a joined-stool, thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious
rich crown for a pitiful bald crown! Falstaff. Well, an the fire of grace
be not quite out of thee, now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack
to make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have wept; for I must
speak in passion, and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein. Henry V. Ned,
prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.
Edward Poins. Where hast been, Hal? Henry V. With three or four loggerheads
amongst three or four score hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string
of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers; and can
call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They
take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but the prince of
Wales, yet I am king of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy, by the Lord,
so they call me, and when I am king of England, I shall command all the
good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet; and when
you breathe in your watering, they cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off.
To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that
I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell
thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour, that thou wert not with me in this
sweet action. But, sweet Ned,—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee
this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into my hand by an under-skinker,
one that never spake other English in his life than 'Eight shillings and
sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon,
sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to drive
away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do thou stand in some by-room,
while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale to me may be nothing
but 'Anon.' Step aside, and I'll show thee a precedent. Edward Poins. Francis!
Henry V. Thou art perfect. Edward Poins. Francis! [Exit POINS] [Enter FRANCIS]
Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph. Henry V.
Come hither, Francis. Francis. My lord? Henry V. How long hast thou to
serve, Francis? Francis. Forsooth, five years, and as much as to— Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Five year!
by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking of pewter. But, Francis, darest
thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
a fair pair of heels and run from it? Francis. O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn
upon all the books in England, I could find in my heart. Edward Poins.
[Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Henry V. How old art thou, Francis?
Francis. Let me see—about Michaelmas next I shall be— Edward Poins. [Within]
Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord. Henry V. Nay,
but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou gavest me,'twas a pennyworth,
wast't not? Francis. O Lord, I would it had been two! Henry V. I will give
thee for it a thousand pound: ask me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have
it. Edward Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon. Henry V. Anon,
Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; or, Francis, o' Thursday;
or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But, Francis! Francis. My lord? Henry
V. Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button, not-pated, agate-ring,
puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,— Francis. O
Lord, sir, who do you mean? Henry V. Why, then, your brown bastard is your
only drink; for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully:
in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much. Francis. What, sir? Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Henry V. Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them
call? [Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed, not knowing which
way to go] [Enter Vintner] Vintner. What, standest thou still, and hearest
such a calling? Look to the guests within. [Exit Francis] My lord, old
Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are at the door: shall I let them in?
Henry V. Let them alone awhile, and then open the door. [Exit Vintner]
Poins! [Re-enter POINS] Edward Poins. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Sirrah,
Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the door: shall we be merry?
Edward Poins. As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what cunning match
have you made with this jest of the drawer? come, what's the issue? Henry
V. I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours since the
old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve o'clock
at midnight. [Re-enter FRANCIS] What's o'clock, Francis? Francis. Anon,
anon, sir. [Exit] Henry V. That ever this fellow should have fewer words
than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is upstairs and
downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's
mind, the Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or seven dozen
of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon
this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she, 'how many
hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he; and answers
'Some fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I prithee, call in
Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer
his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow. [Enter
FALSTAFF, Gadshill, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following with wine] Edward
Poins. Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been? Falstaff. A plague of all cowards,
I say, and a vengeance too! marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy.
Ere I lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend them and foot
them too. A plague of all cowards! Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there
no virtue extant? [He drinks] Henry V. Didst thou never see Titan kiss
a dish of butter? pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound. Falstaff. You rogue,
here's lime in this sack too: there is nothing but roguery to be found
in villanous man: yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in
it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack; die when thou wilt, if manhood,
good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a shotten
herring. There live not three good men unhanged in England; and one of
them is fat and grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say. I would
I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any thing. A plague of all cowards,
I say still. Henry V. How now, wool-sack! what mutter you? Falstaff. A
king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath,
and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese, I'll
never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales! Henry V. Why, you
whoreson round man, what's the matter? Falstaff. Are not you a coward?
answer me to that: and Poins there? Edward Poins. 'Zounds, ye fat paunch,
an ye call me coward, by the Lord, I'll stab thee. Falstaff. I call thee
coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call thee coward: but I would give a
thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough
in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back: call you that backing
of your friends? A plague upon such backing! give me them that will face
me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I drunk to-day. Henry V. O
villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last. Falstaff.
All's one for that. [He drinks] A plague of all cowards, still say I. Henry
V. What's the matter? Falstaff. What's the matter! there be four of us
here have ta'en a thousand pound this day morning. Henry V. Where is it,
Jack? where is it? Falstaff. Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred
upon poor four of us. Henry V. What, a hundred, man? Falstaff. I am a rogue,
if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two hours together. I
have 'scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four
through the hose; my buckler cut through and through; my sword hacked like
a hand-saw—ecce signum! I never dealt better since I was a man: all would
not do. A plague of all cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness. Henry V. Speak,
sirs; how was it? Gadshill. We four set upon some dozen— Falstaff. Sixteen
at least, my lord. Gadshill. And bound them. Peto. No, no, they were not
bound. Falstaff. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I am
a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew. Gadshill. As we were sharing, some six or seven
fresh men set upon us— Falstaff. And unbound the rest, and then come in
the other. Henry V. What, fought you with them all? Falstaff. All! I know
not what you call all; but if I fought not with fifty of them, I am a bunch
of radish: if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack,
then am I no two-legged creature. Henry V. Pray God you have not murdered
some of them. Falstaff. Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell
thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in
buckram let drive at me— Henry V. What, four? thou saidst but two even
now. Falstaff. Four, Hal; I told thee four. Edward Poins. Ay, ay, he said
four. Falstaff. These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at me. I
made me no more ado but took all their seven points in my target, thus.
Henry V. Seven? why, there were but four even now. Falstaff. In buckram?
Edward Poins. Ay, four, in buckram suits. Falstaff. Seven, by these hilts,
or I am a villain else. Henry V. Prithee, let him alone; we shall have
more anon. Falstaff. Dost thou hear me, Hal? Henry V. Ay, and mark thee
too, Jack. Falstaff. Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
in buckram that I told thee of— Henry V. So, two more already. Falstaff.
Their points being broken,— Edward Poins. Down fell their hose. Falstaff.
Began to give me ground: but I followed me close, came in foot and hand;
and with a thought seven of the eleven I paid. Henry V. O monstrous! eleven
buckram men grown out of two! Falstaff. But, as the devil would have it,
three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand. Henry
V. These lies are like their father that begets them; gross as a mountain,
open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,— Falstaff. What, art thou mad?
art thou mad? is not the truth the truth? Henry V. Why, how couldst thou
know these men in Kendal green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see
thy hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this? Edward Poins.
Come, your reason, Jack, your reason. Falstaff. What, upon compulsion?
'Zounds, an I were at the strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion! If reasons
were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion,
I. Henry V. I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine coward,
this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker, this huge hill of flesh,— Falstaff.
'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried neat's tongue, you bull's
pizzle, you stock-fish! O for breath to utter what is like thee! you tailor's-yard,
you sheath, you bowcase; you vile standing-tuck,— Henry V. Well, breathe
awhile, and then to it again: and when thou hast tired thyself in base
comparisons, hear me speak but this. Edward Poins. Mark, Jack. Henry V.
We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and were masters of their
wealth. Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down. Then did we two
set on you four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your prize, and have
it; yea, and can show it you here in the house: and, Falstaff, you carried
your guts away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy
and still run and roared, as ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou,
to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight! What
trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst thou now find out to hide
thee from this open and apparent shame? Edward Poins. Come, let's hear,
Jack; what trick hast thou now? Falstaff. By the Lord, I knew ye as well
as he that made ye. Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince? why, thou knowest I
am as valiant as Hercules: but beware instinct; the lion will not touch
the true prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a coward on instinct.
I shall think the better of myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you
have the money. Hostess, clap to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship
come to you! What, shall we be merry? shall we have a play extempore? Henry
V. Content; and the argument shall be thy running away. Falstaff. Ah, no
more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me! [Enter Hostess] Hostess Quickly.
O Jesu, my lord the prince! Henry V. How now, my lady the hostess! what
sayest thou to me? Hostess Quickly. Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman
of the court at door would speak with you: he says he comes from your father.
Henry V. Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him back
again to my mother. Falstaff. What manner of man is he? Hostess Quickly.
An old man. Falstaff. What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
I give him his answer? Henry V. Prithee, do, Jack. Falstaff. 'Faith, and
I'll send him packing. [Exit FALSTAFF] Henry V. Now, sirs: by'r lady, you
fought fair; so did you, Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too,
you ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true prince; no, fie!
Lord Bardolph. 'Faith, I ran when I saw others run. Henry V. 'Faith, tell
me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's sword so hacked? Peto. Why, he hacked
it with his dagger, and said he would swear truth out of England but he
would make you believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the
like. Lord Bardolph. Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to make
them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was
the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
to hear his monstrous devices. Henry V. O villain, thou stolest a cup of
sack eighteen years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and
yet thou rannest away: what instinct hadst thou for it? Lord Bardolph.
My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold these exhalations? Henry
V. I do. Lord Bardolph. What think you they portend? Henry V. Hot livers
and cold purses. Lord Bardolph. Choler, my lord, if rightly taken. Henry
V. No, if rightly taken, halter. [Re-enter FALSTAFF] Here comes lean Jack,
here comes bare-bone. How now, my sweet creature of bombast! How long is't
ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee? Falstaff. My own knee! when
I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle's talon in the waist; I
could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of sighing and
grief! it blows a man up like a bladder. There's villanous news abroad:
here was Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the court in the
morning. That same mad fellow of the north, Percy, and he of Wales, that
gave Amamon the bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the devil
his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook—what a plague call you
him? Edward Poins. O, Glendower. Falstaff. Owen, Owen, the same; and his
son-in-law Mortimer, and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill perpendicular,— Henry
V. He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying.
Falstaff. You have hit it. Henry V. So did he never the sparrow. Falstaff.
Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run. Henry V. Why,
what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for running! Falstaff. O'
horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot. Henry V. Yes,
Jack, upon instinct. Falstaff. I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there
too, and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more: Worcester is stolen
away to-night; thy father's beard is turned white with the news: you may
buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel. Henry V. Why, then, it is like,
if there come a hot June and this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds. Falstaff. By the mass, lad, thou
sayest true; it is like we shall have good trading that way. But tell me,
Hal, art not thou horrible afeard? thou being heir-apparent, could the
world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid? doth
not thy blood thrill at it? Henry V. Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some
of thy instinct. Falstaff. Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when
thou comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer. Henry V.
Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the particulars of my
life. Falstaff. Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state, this dagger
my sceptre, and this cushion my crown. Henry V. Thy state is taken for
a joined-stool, thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious
rich crown for a pitiful bald crown! Falstaff. Well, an the fire of grace
be not quite out of thee, now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack
to make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have wept; for I must
speak in passion, and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein. Henry V. Ned,
prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.
Edward Poins. Where hast been, Hal? Henry V. With three or four loggerheads
amongst three or four score hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string
of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers; and can
call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They
take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but the prince of
Wales, yet I am king of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy, by the Lord,
so they call me, and when I am king of England, I shall command all the
good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet; and when
you breathe in your watering, they cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off.
To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that
I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell
thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour, that thou wert not with me in this
sweet action. But, sweet Ned,—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee
this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into my hand by an under-skinker,
one that never spake other English in his life than 'Eight shillings and
sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon,
sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to drive
away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do thou stand in some by-room,
while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale to me may be nothing
but 'Anon.' Step aside, and I'll show thee a precedent. Edward Poins. Francis!
Henry V. Thou art perfect. Edward Poins. Francis! [Exit POINS] [Enter FRANCIS]
Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph. Henry V.
Come hither, Francis. Francis. My lord? Henry V. How long hast thou to
serve, Francis? Francis. Forsooth, five years, and as much as to— Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Five year!
by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking of pewter. But, Francis, darest
thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
a fair pair of heels and run from it? Francis. O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn
upon all the books in England, I could find in my heart. Edward Poins.
[Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Henry V. How old art thou, Francis?
Francis. Let me see—about Michaelmas next I shall be— Edward Poins. [Within]
Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord. Henry V. Nay,
but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou gavest me,'twas a pennyworth,
wast't not? Francis. O Lord, I would it had been two! Henry V. I will give
thee for it a thousand pound: ask me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have
it. Edward Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon. Henry V. Anon,
Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; or, Francis, o' Thursday;
or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But, Francis! Francis. My lord? Henry
V. Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button, not-pated, agate-ring,
puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,— Francis. O
Lord, sir, who do you mean? Henry V. Why, then, your brown bastard is your
only drink; for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully:
in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much. Francis. What, sir? Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Henry V. Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them
call? [Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed, not knowing which
way to go] [Enter Vintner] Vintner. What, standest thou still, and hearest
such a calling? Look to the guests within. [Exit Francis] My lord, old
Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are at the door: shall I let them in?
Henry V. Let them alone awhile, and then open the door. [Exit Vintner]
Poins! [Re-enter POINS] Edward Poins. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Sirrah,
Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the door: shall we be merry?
Edward Poins. As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what cunning match
have you made with this jest of the drawer? come, what's the issue? Henry
V. I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours since the
old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve o'clock
at midnight. [Re-enter FRANCIS] What's o'clock, Francis? Francis. Anon,
anon, sir. [Exit] Henry V. That ever this fellow should have fewer words
than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is upstairs and
downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's
mind, the Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or seven dozen
of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon
this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she, 'how many
hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he; and answers
'Some fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I prithee, call in
Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer
his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow. [Enter
FALSTAFF, Gadshill, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following with wine] Edward
Poins. Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been? Falstaff. A plague of all cowards,
I say, and a vengeance too! marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy.
Ere I lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend them and foot
them too. A plague of all cowards! Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there
no virtue extant? [He drinks] Henry V. Didst thou never see Titan kiss
a dish of butter? pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound. Falstaff. You rogue,
here's lime in this sack too: there is nothing but roguery to be found
in villanous man: yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in
it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack; die when thou wilt, if manhood,
good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a shotten
herring. There live not three good men unhanged in England; and one of
them is fat and grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say. I would
I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any thing. A plague of all cowards,
I say still. Henry V. How now, wool-sack! what mutter you? Falstaff. A
king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath,
and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese, I'll
never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales! Henry V. Why, you
whoreson round man, what's the matter? Falstaff. Are not you a coward?
answer me to that: and Poins there? Edward Poins. 'Zounds, ye fat paunch,
an ye call me coward, by the Lord, I'll stab thee. Falstaff. I call thee
coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call thee coward: but I would give a
thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough
in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back: call you that backing
of your friends? A plague upon such backing! give me them that will face
me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I drunk to-day. Henry V. O
villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last. Falstaff.
All's one for that. [He drinks] A plague of all cowards, still say I. Henry
V. What's the matter? Falstaff. What's the matter! there be four of us
here have ta'en a thousand pound this day morning. Henry V. Where is it,
Jack? where is it? Falstaff. Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred
upon poor four of us. Henry V. What, a hundred, man? Falstaff. I am a rogue,
if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two hours together. I
have 'scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four
through the hose; my buckler cut through and through; my sword hacked like
a hand-saw—ecce signum! I never dealt better since I was a man: all would
not do. A plague of all cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness. Henry V. Speak,
sirs; how was it? Gadshill. We four set upon some dozen— Falstaff. Sixteen
at least, my lord. Gadshill. And bound them. Peto. No, no, they were not
bound. Falstaff. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I am
a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew. Gadshill. As we were sharing, some six or seven
fresh men set upon us— Falstaff. And unbound the rest, and then come in
the other. Henry V. What, fought you with them all? Falstaff. All! I know
not what you call all; but if I fought not with fifty of them, I am a bunch
of radish: if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack,
then am I no two-legged creature. Henry V. Pray God you have not murdered
some of them. Falstaff. Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell
thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in
buckram let drive at me— Henry V. What, four? thou saidst but two even
now. Falstaff. Four, Hal; I told thee four. Edward Poins. Ay, ay, he said
four. Falstaff. These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at me. I
made me no more ado but took all their seven points in my target, thus.
Henry V. Seven? why, there were but four even now. Falstaff. In buckram?
Edward Poins. Ay, four, in buckram suits. Falstaff. Seven, by these hilts,
or I am a villain else. Henry V. Prithee, let him alone; we shall have
more anon. Falstaff. Dost thou hear me, Hal? Henry V. Ay, and mark thee
too, Jack. Falstaff. Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
in buckram that I told thee of— Henry V. So, two more already. Falstaff.
Their points being broken,— Edward Poins. Down fell their hose. Falstaff.
Began to give me ground: but I followed me close, came in foot and hand;
and with a thought seven of the eleven I paid. Henry V. O monstrous! eleven
buckram men grown out of two! Falstaff. But, as the devil would have it,
three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand. Henry
V. These lies are like their father that begets them; gross as a mountain,
open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,— Falstaff. What, art thou mad?
art thou mad? is not the truth the truth? Henry V. Why, how couldst thou
know these men in Kendal green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see
thy hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this? Edward Poins.
Come, your reason, Jack, your reason. Falstaff. What, upon compulsion?
'Zounds, an I were at the strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion! If reasons
were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion,
I. Henry V. I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine coward,
this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker, this huge hill of flesh,— Falstaff.
'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried neat's tongue, you bull's
pizzle, you stock-fish! O for breath to utter what is like thee! you tailor's-yard,
you sheath, you bowcase; you vile standing-tuck,— Henry V. Well, breathe
awhile, and then to it again: and when thou hast tired thyself in base
comparisons, hear me speak but this. Edward Poins. Mark, Jack. Henry V.
We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and were masters of their
wealth. Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down. Then did we two
set on you four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your prize, and have
it; yea, and can show it you here in the house: and, Falstaff, you carried
your guts away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy
and still run and roared, as ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou,
to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight! What
trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst thou now find out to hide
thee from this open and apparent shame? Edward Poins. Come, let's hear,
Jack; what trick hast thou now? Falstaff. By the Lord, I knew ye as well
as he that made ye. Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince? why, thou knowest I
am as valiant as Hercules: but beware instinct; the lion will not touch
the true prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a coward on instinct.
I shall think the better of myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you
have the money. Hostess, clap to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship
come to you! What, shall we be merry? shall we have a play extempore? Henry
V. Content; and the argument shall be thy running away. Falstaff. Ah, no
more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me! [Enter Hostess] Hostess Quickly.
O Jesu, my lord the prince! Henry V. How now, my lady the hostess! what
sayest thou to me? Hostess Quickly. Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman
of the court at door would speak with you: he says he comes from your father.
Henry V. Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him back
again to my mother. Falstaff. What manner of man is he? Hostess Quickly.
An old man. Falstaff. What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
I give him his answer? Henry V. Prithee, do, Jack. Falstaff. 'Faith, and
I'll send him packing. [Exit FALSTAFF] Henry V. Now, sirs: by'r lady, you
fought fair; so did you, Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too,
you ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true prince; no, fie!
Lord Bardolph. 'Faith, I ran when I saw others run. Henry V. 'Faith, tell
me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's sword so hacked? Peto. Why, he hacked
it with his dagger, and said he would swear truth out of England but he
would make you believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the
like. Lord Bardolph. Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to make
them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was
the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
to hear his monstrous devices. Henry V. O villain, thou stolest a cup of
sack eighteen years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and
yet thou rannest away: what instinct hadst thou for it? Lord Bardolph.
My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold these exhalations? Henry
V. I do. Lord Bardolph. What think you they portend? Henry V. Hot livers
and cold purses. Lord Bardolph. Choler, my lord, if rightly taken. Henry
V. No, if rightly taken, halter. [Re-enter FALSTAFF] Here comes lean Jack,
here comes bare-bone. How now, my sweet creature of bombast! How long is't
ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee? Falstaff. My own knee! when
I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle's talon in the waist; I
could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of sighing and
grief! it blows a man up like a bladder. There's villanous news abroad:

son-in-law Mortimer, and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill perpendicular,— Henry
V. He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying.
Falstaff. You have hit it. Henry V. So did he never the sparrow. Falstaff.
Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run. Henry V. Why,
what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for running! Falstaff. O'
horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot. Henry V. Yes,
Jack, upon instinct. Falstaff. I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there
too, and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more: Worcester is stolen

Hal, art not thou horrible afeard? thou being heir-apparent, could the
world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid? doth
not thy blood thrill at it? Henry V. Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some
of thy instinct. Falstaff. Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when
thou comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer. Henry V.
Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the particulars of my
life. Falstaff. Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state, this dagger

a joined-stool, thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious
rich crown for a pitiful bald crown! Falstaff. Well, an the fire of grace

to make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have wept; for I must
speak in passion, and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein. Henry V. Ned,
prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.
Edward Poins. Where hast been, Hal? Henry V. With three or four loggerheads
amongst three or four score hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string
of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers; and can
call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They
take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but the prince of

To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that

one that never spake other English in his life than 'Eight shillings and
sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon,
sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to drive
away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do thou stand in some by-room,
while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale to me may be nothing
but 'Anon.' Step aside, and I'll show thee a precedent. Edward Poins. Francis!
Henry V. Thou art perfect. Edward Poins. Francis! [Exit POINS] [Enter FRANCIS]
Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph. Henry V.
Come hither, Francis. Francis. My lord? Henry V. How long hast thou to
serve, Francis? Francis. Forsooth, five years, and as much as to— Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Five year!
by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking of pewter. But, Francis, darest
thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
a fair pair of heels and run from it? Francis. O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn
upon all the books in England, I could find in my heart. Edward Poins.
[Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Henry V. How old art thou, Francis?
Francis. Let me see—about Michaelmas next I shall be— Edward Poins. [Within]
Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord. Henry V. Nay,
but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou gavest me,'twas a pennyworth,
wast't not? Francis. O Lord, I would it had been two! Henry V. I will give
thee for it a thousand pound: ask me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have
it. Edward Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon. Henry V. Anon,
Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; or, Francis, o' Thursday;
or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But, Francis! Francis. My lord? Henry
V. Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button, not-pated, agate-ring,
puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,— Francis. O
Lord, sir, who do you mean? Henry V. Why, then, your brown bastard is your
only drink; for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully:
in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much. Francis. What, sir? Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Henry V. Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them
call? [Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed, not knowing which
way to go] [Enter Vintner] Vintner. What, standest thou still, and hearest
such a calling? Look to the guests within. [Exit Francis] My lord, old
Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are at the door: shall I let them in?
Henry V. Let them alone awhile, and then open the door. [Exit Vintner]
Poins! [Re-enter POINS] Edward Poins. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Sirrah,
Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the door: shall we be merry?
Edward Poins. As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what cunning match
have you made with this jest of the drawer? come, what's the issue? Henry
V. I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours since the
old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve o'clock
at midnight. [Re-enter FRANCIS] What's o'clock, Francis? Francis. Anon,
anon, sir. [Exit] Henry V. That ever this fellow should have fewer words
than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is upstairs and
downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's
mind, the Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or seven dozen
of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon
this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she, 'how many
hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he; and answers
'Some fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I prithee, call in
Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer
his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow. [Enter
FALSTAFF, Gadshill, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following with wine] Edward
Poins. Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been? Falstaff. A plague of all cowards,
I say, and a vengeance too! marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy.
Ere I lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend them and foot
them too. A plague of all cowards! Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there
no virtue extant? [He drinks] Henry V. Didst thou never see Titan kiss
a dish of butter? pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound. Falstaff. You rogue,
here's lime in this sack too: there is nothing but roguery to be found
in villanous man: yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in
it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack; die when thou wilt, if manhood,
good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a shotten
herring. There live not three good men unhanged in England; and one of
them is fat and grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say. I would
I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any thing. A plague of all cowards,
I say still. Henry V. How now, wool-sack! what mutter you? Falstaff. A
king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath,
and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese, I'll
never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales! Henry V. Why, you
whoreson round man, what's the matter? Falstaff. Are not you a coward?
answer me to that: and Poins there? Edward Poins. 'Zounds, ye fat paunch,
an ye call me coward, by the Lord, I'll stab thee. Falstaff. I call thee
coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call thee coward: but I would give a
thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough
in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back: call you that backing
of your friends? A plague upon such backing! give me them that will face
me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I drunk to-day. Henry V. O
villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last. Falstaff.
All's one for that. [He drinks] A plague of all cowards, still say I. Henry
V. What's the matter? Falstaff. What's the matter! there be four of us
here have ta'en a thousand pound this day morning. Henry V. Where is it,
Jack? where is it? Falstaff. Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred
upon poor four of us. Henry V. What, a hundred, man? Falstaff. I am a rogue,
if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two hours together. I
have 'scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four
through the hose; my buckler cut through and through; my sword hacked like
a hand-saw—ecce signum! I never dealt better since I was a man: all would
not do. A plague of all cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness. Henry V. Speak,
sirs; how was it? Gadshill. We four set upon some dozen— Falstaff. Sixteen
at least, my lord. Gadshill. And bound them. Peto. No, no, they were not
bound. Falstaff. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I am
a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew. Gadshill. As we were sharing, some six or seven
fresh men set upon us— Falstaff. And unbound the rest, and then come in
the other. Henry V. What, fought you with them all? Falstaff. All! I know
not what you call all; but if I fought not with fifty of them, I am a bunch
of radish: if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack,
then am I no two-legged creature. Henry V. Pray God you have not murdered
some of them. Falstaff. Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell
thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in
buckram let drive at me— Henry V. What, four? thou saidst but two even
now. Falstaff. Four, Hal; I told thee four. Edward Poins. Ay, ay, he said
four. Falstaff. These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at me. I
made me no more ado but took all their seven points in my target, thus.
Henry V. Seven? why, there were but four even now. Falstaff. In buckram?
Edward Poins. Ay, four, in buckram suits. Falstaff. Seven, by these hilts,
or I am a villain else. Henry V. Prithee, let him alone; we shall have
more anon. Falstaff. Dost thou hear me, Hal? Henry V. Ay, and mark thee
too, Jack. Falstaff. Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
in buckram that I told thee of— Henry V. So, two more already. Falstaff.
Their points being broken,— Edward Poins. Down fell their hose. Falstaff.
Began to give me ground: but I followed me close, came in foot and hand;
and with a thought seven of the eleven I paid. Henry V. O monstrous! eleven
buckram men grown out of two! Falstaff. But, as the devil would have it,
three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand. Henry
V. These lies are like their father that begets them; gross as a mountain,
open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,— Falstaff. What, art thou mad?
art thou mad? is not the truth the truth? Henry V. Why, how couldst thou
know these men in Kendal green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see
thy hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this? Edward Poins.
Come, your reason, Jack, your reason. Falstaff. What, upon compulsion?
'Zounds, an I were at the strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion! If reasons
were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion,
I. Henry V. I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine coward,
this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker, this huge hill of flesh,— Falstaff.
'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried neat's tongue, you bull's
pizzle, you stock-fish! O for breath to utter what is like thee! you tailor's-yard,
you sheath, you bowcase; you vile standing-tuck,— Henry V. Well, breathe
awhile, and then to it again: and when thou hast tired thyself in base
comparisons, hear me speak but this. Edward Poins. Mark, Jack. Henry V.
We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and were masters of their
wealth. Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down. Then did we two
set on you four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your prize, and have
it; yea, and can show it you here in the house: and, Falstaff, you carried
your guts away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy
and still run and roared, as ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou,
to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight! What
trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst thou now find out to hide
thee from this open and apparent shame? Edward Poins. Come, let's hear,
Jack; what trick hast thou now? Falstaff. By the Lord, I knew ye as well
as he that made ye. Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince? why, thou knowest I
am as valiant as Hercules: but beware instinct; the lion will not touch
the true prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a coward on instinct.
I shall think the better of myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you
have the money. Hostess, clap to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship
come to you! What, shall we be merry? shall we have a play extempore? Henry
V. Content; and the argument shall be thy running away. Falstaff. Ah, no
more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me! [Enter Hostess] Hostess Quickly.
O Jesu, my lord the prince! Henry V. How now, my lady the hostess! what
sayest thou to me? Hostess Quickly. Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman
of the court at door would speak with you: he says he comes from your father.
Henry V. Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him back
again to my mother. Falstaff. What manner of man is he? Hostess Quickly.
An old man. Falstaff. What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
I give him his answer? Henry V. Prithee, do, Jack. Falstaff. 'Faith, and
I'll send him packing. [Exit FALSTAFF] Henry V. Now, sirs: by'r lady, you
fought fair; so did you, Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too,
you ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true prince; no, fie!
Lord Bardolph. 'Faith, I ran when I saw others run. Henry V. 'Faith, tell
me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's sword so hacked? Peto. Why, he hacked
it with his dagger, and said he would swear truth out of England but he
would make you believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the
like. Lord Bardolph. Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to make
them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was
the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
to hear his monstrous devices. Henry V. O villain, thou stolest a cup of
sack eighteen years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and
yet thou rannest away: what instinct hadst thou for it? Lord Bardolph.
My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold these exhalations? Henry
V. I do. Lord Bardolph. What think you they portend? Henry V. Hot livers
and cold purses. Lord Bardolph. Choler, my lord, if rightly taken. Henry
V. No, if rightly taken, halter. [Re-enter FALSTAFF] Here comes lean Jack,
here comes bare-bone. How now, my sweet creature of bombast! How long is't
ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee? Falstaff. My own knee! when
I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle's talon in the waist; I
could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of sighing and
grief! it blows a man up like a bladder. There's villanous news abroad:
here was Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the court in the
morning. That same mad fellow of the north, Percy, and he of Wales, that
gave Amamon the bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the devil
his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook—what a plague call you
him? Edward Poins. O, Glendower. Falstaff. Owen, Owen, the same; and his
son-in-law Mortimer, and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill perpendicular,— Henry
V. He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying.
Falstaff. You have hit it. Henry V. So did he never the sparrow. Falstaff.
Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run. Henry V. Why,
what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for running! Falstaff. O'
horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot. Henry V. Yes,
Jack, upon instinct. Falstaff. I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there
too, and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more: Worcester is stolen
away to-night; thy father's beard is turned white with the news: you may
buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel. Henry V. Why, then, it is like,
if there come a hot June and this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds. Falstaff. By the mass, lad, thou
sayest true; it is like we shall have good trading that way. But tell me,
Hal, art not thou horrible afeard? thou being heir-apparent, could the
world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid? doth
not thy blood thrill at it? Henry V. Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some
of thy instinct. Falstaff. Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when
thou comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer. Henry V.
Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the particulars of my
life. Falstaff. Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state, this dagger
my sceptre, and this cushion my crown. Henry V. Thy state is taken for
a joined-stool, thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious
rich crown for a pitiful bald crown! Falstaff. Well, an the fire of grace
be not quite out of thee, now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack
to make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have wept; for I must
speak in passion, and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein. Henry V. Ned,
prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.
Edward Poins. Where hast been, Hal? Henry V. With three or four loggerheads
amongst three or four score hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string
of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers; and can
call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They
take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but the prince of
Wales, yet I am king of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy, by the Lord,
so they call me, and when I am king of England, I shall command all the
good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet; and when
you breathe in your watering, they cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off.
To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that
I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell
thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour, that thou wert not with me in this
sweet action. But, sweet Ned,—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee
this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into my hand by an under-skinker,
one that never spake other English in his life than 'Eight shillings and
sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon,
sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to drive
away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do thou stand in some by-room,
while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale to me may be nothing
but 'Anon.' Step aside, and I'll show thee a precedent. Edward Poins. Francis!
Henry V. Thou art perfect. Edward Poins. Francis! [Exit POINS] [Enter FRANCIS]
Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph. Henry V.
Come hither, Francis. Francis. My lord? Henry V. How long hast thou to
serve, Francis? Francis. Forsooth, five years, and as much as to— Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Five year!
by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking of pewter. But, Francis, darest
thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
a fair pair of heels and run from it? Francis. O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn
upon all the books in England, I could find in my heart. Edward Poins.
[Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Henry V. How old art thou, Francis?
Francis. Let me see—about Michaelmas next I shall be— Edward Poins. [Within]
Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord. Henry V. Nay,
but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou gavest me,'twas a pennyworth,
wast't not? Francis. O Lord, I would it had been two! Henry V. I will give
thee for it a thousand pound: ask me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have
it. Edward Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon. Henry V. Anon,
Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; or, Francis, o' Thursday;
or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But, Francis! Francis. My lord? Henry
V. Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button, not-pated, agate-ring,
puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,— Francis. O
Lord, sir, who do you mean? Henry V. Why, then, your brown bastard is your
only drink; for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully:
in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much. Francis. What, sir? Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Henry V. Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them
call? [Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed, not knowing which
way to go] [Enter Vintner] Vintner. What, standest thou still, and hearest
such a calling? Look to the guests within. [Exit Francis] My lord, old
Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are at the door: shall I let them in?
Henry V. Let them alone awhile, and then open the door. [Exit Vintner]
Poins! [Re-enter POINS] Edward Poins. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Sirrah,
Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the door: shall we be merry?
Edward Poins. As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what cunning match
have you made with this jest of the drawer? come, what's the issue? Henry
V. I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours since the
old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve o'clock
at midnight. [Re-enter FRANCIS] What's o'clock, Francis? Francis. Anon,
anon, sir. [Exit] Henry V. That ever this fellow should have fewer words
than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is upstairs and
downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's
mind, the Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or seven dozen
of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon
this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she, 'how many
hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he; and answers
'Some fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I prithee, call in
Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer
his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow. [Enter
FALSTAFF, Gadshill, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following with wine] Edward
Poins. Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been? Falstaff. A plague of all cowards,
I say, and a vengeance too! marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy.
Ere I lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend them and foot
them too. A plague of all cowards! Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there
no virtue extant? [He drinks] Henry V. Didst thou never see Titan kiss
a dish of butter? pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound. Falstaff. You rogue,
here's lime in this sack too: there is nothing but roguery to be found
in villanous man: yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in
it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack; die when thou wilt, if manhood,
good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a shotten
herring. There live not three good men unhanged in England; and one of
them is fat and grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say. I would
I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any thing. A plague of all cowards,
I say still. Henry V. How now, wool-sack! what mutter you? Falstaff. A
king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath,
and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese, I'll
never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales! Henry V. Why, you
whoreson round man, what's the matter? Falstaff. Are not you a coward?
answer me to that: and Poins there? Edward Poins. 'Zounds, ye fat paunch,
an ye call me coward, by the Lord, I'll stab thee. Falstaff. I call thee
coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call thee coward: but I would give a
thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough
in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back: call you that backing
of your friends? A plague upon such backing! give me them that will face
me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I drunk to-day. Henry V. O
villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last. Falstaff.
All's one for that. [He drinks] A plague of all cowards, still say I. Henry
V. What's the matter? Falstaff. What's the matter! there be four of us
here have ta'en a thousand pound this day morning. Henry V. Where is it,
Jack? where is it? Falstaff. Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred
upon poor four of us. Henry V. What, a hundred, man? Falstaff. I am a rogue,
if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two hours together. I
have 'scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four
through the hose; my buckler cut through and through; my sword hacked like
a hand-saw—ecce signum! I never dealt better since I was a man: all would
not do. A plague of all cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness. Henry V. Speak,
sirs; how was it? Gadshill. We four set upon some dozen— Falstaff. Sixteen
at least, my lord. Gadshill. And bound them. Peto. No, no, they were not
bound. Falstaff. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I am
a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew. Gadshill. As we were sharing, some six or seven
fresh men set upon us— Falstaff. And unbound the rest, and then come in
the other. Henry V. What, fought you with them all? Falstaff. All! I know
not what you call all; but if I fought not with fifty of them, I am a bunch
of radish: if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack,
then am I no two-legged creature. Henry V. Pray God you have not murdered
some of them. Falstaff. Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell
thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in
buckram let drive at me— Henry V. What, four? thou saidst but two even
now. Falstaff. Four, Hal; I told thee four. Edward Poins. Ay, ay, he said
four. Falstaff. These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at me. I
made me no more ado but took all their seven points in my target, thus.
Henry V. Seven? why, there were but four even now. Falstaff. In buckram?
Edward Poins. Ay, four, in buckram suits. Falstaff. Seven, by these hilts,
or I am a villain else. Henry V. Prithee, let him alone; we shall have
more anon. Falstaff. Dost thou hear me, Hal? Henry V. Ay, and mark thee
too, Jack. Falstaff. Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
in buckram that I told thee of— Henry V. So, two more already. Falstaff.
Their points being broken,— Edward Poins. Down fell their hose. Falstaff.
Began to give me ground: but I followed me close, came in foot and hand;
and with a thought seven of the eleven I paid. Henry V. O monstrous! eleven
buckram men grown out of two! Falstaff. But, as the devil would have it,
three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand. Henry
V. These lies are like their father that begets them; gross as a mountain,
open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,— Falstaff. What, art thou mad?
art thou mad? is not the truth the truth? Henry V. Why, how couldst thou
know these men in Kendal green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see
thy hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this? Edward Poins.
Come, your reason, Jack, your reason. Falstaff. What, upon compulsion?
'Zounds, an I were at the strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion! If reasons
were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion,
I. Henry V. I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine coward,
this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker, this huge hill of flesh,— Falstaff.
'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried neat's tongue, you bull's
pizzle, you stock-fish! O for breath to utter what is like thee! you tailor's-yard,
you sheath, you bowcase; you vile standing-tuck,— Henry V. Well, breathe
awhile, and then to it again: and when thou hast tired thyself in base
comparisons, hear me speak but this. Edward Poins. Mark, Jack. Henry V.
We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and were masters of their
wealth. Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down. Then did we two
set on you four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your prize, and have
it; yea, and can show it you here in the house: and, Falstaff, you carried
your guts away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy
and still run and roared, as ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou,
to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight! What
trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst thou now find out to hide
thee from this open and apparent shame? Edward Poins. Come, let's hear,
Jack; what trick hast thou now? Falstaff. By the Lord, I knew ye as well
as he that made ye. Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince? why, thou knowest I
am as valiant as Hercules: but beware instinct; the lion will not touch
the true prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a coward on instinct.
I shall think the better of myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you
have the money. Hostess, clap to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship
come to you! What, shall we be merry? shall we have a play extempore? Henry
V. Content; and the argument shall be thy running away. Falstaff. Ah, no
more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me! [Enter Hostess] Hostess Quickly.
O Jesu, my lord the prince! Henry V. How now, my lady the hostess! what
sayest thou to me? Hostess Quickly. Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman
of the court at door would speak with you: he says he comes from your father.
Henry V. Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him back
again to my mother. Falstaff. What manner of man is he? Hostess Quickly.
An old man. Falstaff. What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
I give him his answer? Henry V. Prithee, do, Jack. Falstaff. 'Faith, and
I'll send him packing. [Exit FALSTAFF] Henry V. Now, sirs: by'r lady, you
fought fair; so did you, Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too,
you ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true prince; no, fie!
Lord Bardolph. 'Faith, I ran when I saw others run. Henry V. 'Faith, tell
me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's sword so hacked? Peto. Why, he hacked
it with his dagger, and said he would swear truth out of England but he
would make you believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the
like. Lord Bardolph. Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to make
them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was
the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
to hear his monstrous devices. Henry V. O villain, thou stolest a cup of
sack eighteen years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and
yet thou rannest away: what instinct hadst thou for it? Lord Bardolph.
My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold these exhalations? Henry
V. I do. Lord Bardolph. What think you they portend? Henry V. Hot livers
and cold purses. Lord Bardolph. Choler, my lord, if rightly taken. Henry
V. No, if rightly taken, halter. [Re-enter FALSTAFF] Here comes lean Jack,
here comes bare-bone. How now, my sweet creature of bombast! How long is't
ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee? Falstaff. My own knee! when
I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle's talon in the waist; I
could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of sighing and
grief! it blows a man up like a bladder. There's villanous news abroad:
here was Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the court in the
morning. That same mad fellow of the north, Percy, and he of Wales, that
gave Amamon the bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the devil
his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook—what a plague call you
him? Edward Poins. O, Glendower. Falstaff. Owen, Owen, the same; and his
son-in-law Mortimer, and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill perpendicular,— Henry
V. He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying.
Falstaff. You have hit it. Henry V. So did he never the sparrow. Falstaff.
Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run. Henry V. Why,
what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for running! Falstaff. O'
horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot. Henry V. Yes,
Jack, upon instinct. Falstaff. I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there
too, and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more: Worcester is stolen
away to-night; thy father's beard is turned white with the news: you may
buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel. Henry V. Why, then, it is like,
if there come a hot June and this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds. Falstaff. By the mass, lad, thou
sayest true; it is like we shall have good trading that way. But tell me,
Hal, art not thou horrible afeard? thou being heir-apparent, could the
world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid? doth
not thy blood thrill at it? Henry V. Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some
of thy instinct. Falstaff. Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when
thou comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer. Henry V.
Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the particulars of my
life. Falstaff. Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state, this dagger
my sceptre, and this cushion my crown. Henry V. Thy state is taken for
a joined-stool, thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious
rich crown for a pitiful bald crown! Falstaff. Well, an the fire of grace
be not quite out of thee, now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack
to make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have wept; for I must
speak in passion, and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein. Henry V. Ned,
prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.
Edward Poins. Where hast been, Hal? Henry V. With three or four loggerheads
amongst three or four score hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string
of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers; and can
call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They
take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but the prince of
Wales, yet I am king of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy, by the Lord,
so they call me, and when I am king of England, I shall command all the
good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet; and when
you breathe in your watering, they cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off.
To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that
I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell
thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour, that thou wert not with me in this
sweet action. But, sweet Ned,—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee
this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into my hand by an under-skinker,
one that never spake other English in his life than 'Eight shillings and
sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon,
sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to drive
away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do thou stand in some by-room,
while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale to me may be nothing
but 'Anon.' Step aside, and I'll show thee a precedent. Edward Poins. Francis!
Henry V. Thou art perfect. Edward Poins. Francis! [Exit POINS] [Enter FRANCIS]
Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph. Henry V.
Come hither, Francis. Francis. My lord? Henry V. How long hast thou to
serve, Francis? Francis. Forsooth, five years, and as much as to— Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Five year!
by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking of pewter. But, Francis, darest
thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
a fair pair of heels and run from it? Francis. O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn
upon all the books in England, I could find in my heart. Edward Poins.
[Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Henry V. How old art thou, Francis?
Francis. Let me see—about Michaelmas next I shall be— Edward Poins. [Within]
Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord. Henry V. Nay,
but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou gavest me,'twas a pennyworth,
wast't not? Francis. O Lord, I would it had been two! Henry V. I will give
thee for it a thousand pound: ask me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have
it. Edward Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon. Henry V. Anon,
Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; or, Francis, o' Thursday;
or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But, Francis! Francis. My lord? Henry
V. Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button, not-pated, agate-ring,
puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,— Francis. O
Lord, sir, who do you mean? Henry V. Why, then, your brown bastard is your
only drink; for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully:
in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much. Francis. What, sir? Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Henry V. Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them
call? [Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed, not knowing which
way to go] [Enter Vintner] Vintner. What, standest thou still, and hearest
such a calling? Look to the guests within. [Exit Francis] My lord, old
Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are at the door: shall I let them in?
Henry V. Let them alone awhile, and then open the door. [Exit Vintner]
Poins! [Re-enter POINS] Edward Poins. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Sirrah,
Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the door: shall we be merry?
Edward Poins. As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what cunning match
have you made with this jest of the drawer? come, what's the issue? Henry
V. I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours since the
old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve o'clock
at midnight. [Re-enter FRANCIS] What's o'clock, Francis? Francis. Anon,
anon, sir. [Exit] Henry V. That ever this fellow should have fewer words
than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is upstairs and
downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's
mind, the Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or seven dozen
of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon
this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she, 'how many
hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he; and answers
'Some fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I prithee, call in
Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer
his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow. [Enter
FALSTAFF, Gadshill, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following with wine] Edward
Poins. Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been? Falstaff. A plague of all cowards,
I say, and a vengeance too! marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy.
Ere I lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend them and foot
them too. A plague of all cowards! Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there
no virtue extant? [He drinks] Henry V. Didst thou never see Titan kiss
a dish of butter? pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound. Falstaff. You rogue,
here's lime in this sack too: there is nothing but roguery to be found
in villanous man: yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in
it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack; die when thou wilt, if manhood,
good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a shotten
herring. There live not three good men unhanged in England; and one of
them is fat and grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say. I would
I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any thing. A plague of all cowards,
I say still. Henry V. How now, wool-sack! what mutter you? Falstaff. A
king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath,
and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese, I'll
never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales! Henry V. Why, you
whoreson round man, what's the matter? Falstaff. Are not you a coward?
answer me to that: and Poins there? Edward Poins. 'Zounds, ye fat paunch,
an ye call me coward, by the Lord, I'll stab thee. Falstaff. I call thee
coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call thee coward: but I would give a
thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough
in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back: call you that backing
of your friends? A plague upon such backing! give me them that will face
me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I drunk to-day. Henry V. O
villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last. Falstaff.
All's one for that. [He drinks] A plague of all cowards, still say I. Henry
V. What's the matter? Falstaff. What's the matter! there be four of us
here have ta'en a thousand pound this day morning. Henry V. Where is it,
Jack? where is it? Falstaff. Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred
upon poor four of us. Henry V. What, a hundred, man? Falstaff. I am a rogue,
if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two hours together. I
have 'scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four
through the hose; my buckler cut through and through; my sword hacked like
a hand-saw—ecce signum! I never dealt better since I was a man: all would
not do. A plague of all cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness. Henry V. Speak,
sirs; how was it? Gadshill. We four set upon some dozen— Falstaff. Sixteen
at least, my lord. Gadshill. And bound them. Peto. No, no, they were not
bound. Falstaff. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I am
a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew. Gadshill. As we were sharing, some six or seven
fresh men set upon us— Falstaff. And unbound the rest, and then come in
the other. Henry V. What, fought you with them all? Falstaff. All! I know
not what you call all; but if I fought not with fifty of them, I am a bunch
of radish: if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack,
then am I no two-legged creature. Henry V. Pray God you have not murdered
some of them. Falstaff. Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell
thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in
buckram let drive at me— Henry V. What, four? thou saidst but two even
now. Falstaff. Four, Hal; I told thee four. Henry V. Ned, prithee, come
out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand to laugh a little. Edward Poins.
Where hast been, Hal? Henry V. With three or four loggerheads amongst three
or four score hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string of humility.
Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers; and can call them all

Francis. Francis. My lord? Henry V. How long hast thou to serve, Francis?

I lay and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me—
Henry V. What, four? thou saidst but two even now. Falstaff. Four, Hal;
I told thee four. Edward Poins. Ay, ay, he said four. Falstaff. These four
came all a-front, and mainly thrust at me. I made me no more ado but took
all their seven points in my target, thus. Henry V. Seven? why, there were
but four even now. Falstaff. In buckram? Edward Poins. Ay, four, in buckram
suits. Falstaff. Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else. Henry V.
Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon. Falstaff. Dost thou hear
me, Hal? Henry V. Ay, and mark thee too, Jack. Falstaff. Do so, for it
is worth the listening to. These nine in buckram that I told thee of— Henry
V. So, two more already. Falstaff. Their points being broken,— Edward Poins.
Down fell their hose. Falstaff. Began to give me ground: but I followed
me close, came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of the eleven
I paid. Henry V. O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two! Falstaff.
But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green
came at my back and let drive at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou
couldst not see thy hand. Henry V. These lies are like their father that
begets them; gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained
guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,—
Falstaff. What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth the truth?
Henry V. Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green, when it
was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand? come, tell us your reason: what
sayest thou to this? Edward Poins. Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
Falstaff. What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the strappado, or
all the racks in the world, I would not tell you on compulsion. Give you
a reason on compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as blackberries, I
would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I. Henry V. I'll be no longer
guilty of this sin; this sanguine coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,
this huge hill of flesh,— Falstaff. 'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin,
you dried neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O for breath
to utter what is like thee! you tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase;
you vile standing-tuck,— Henry V. Well, breathe awhile, and then to it
again: and when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons, hear me speak
but this. Edward Poins. Mark, Jack. Henry V. We two saw you four set on
four and bound them, and were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a
plain tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you four; and, with
a word, out-faced you from your prize, and have it; yea, and can show it
you here in the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts away as nimbly,
with as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy and still run and roared,
as ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword as
thou hast done, and then say it was in fight! What trick, what device,
what starting-hole, canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open
and apparent shame? Edward Poins. Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast
thou now? Falstaff. By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.
Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the heir-apparent? should
I turn upon the true prince? why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules:
but beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true prince. Instinct
is a great matter; I was now a coward on instinct. I shall think the better
of myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant lion, and thou for a
true prince. But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess,
clap to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow. Gallants, lads, boys,
hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship come to you! What, shall
we be merry? shall we have a play extempore? Henry V. Content; and the
argument shall be thy running away. Falstaff. Ah, no more of that, Hal,
an thou lovest me! [Enter Hostess] Hostess Quickly. O Jesu, my lord the
prince! Henry V. How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to me?
Hostess Quickly. Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at door
would speak with you: he says he comes from your father. Henry V. Give
him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him back again to my
mother. Falstaff. What manner of man is he? Hostess Quickly. An old man.
Falstaff. What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall I give him
his answer? Henry V. Prithee, do, Jack. Falstaff. 'Faith, and I'll send
him packing. [Exit FALSTAFF] Henry V. Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought
fair; so did you, Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you ran
away upon instinct, you will not touch the true prince; no, fie! Lord Bardolph.
'Faith, I ran when I saw others run. Henry V. 'Faith, tell me now in earnest,
how came Falstaff's sword so hacked? Peto. Why, he hacked it with his dagger,
and said he would swear truth out of England but he would make you believe
it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like. Lord Bardolph. Yea,
and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to make them bleed, and then to
beslubber our garments with it and swear it was the blood of true men.
I did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed to hear his monstrous
devices. Henry V. O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since thou hast blushed extempore.
Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what
instinct hadst thou for it? Lord Bardolph. My lord, do you see these meteors?
do you behold these exhalations? Henry V. I do. Lord Bardolph. What think
you they portend? Henry V. Hot livers and cold purses. Lord Bardolph. Choler,
my lord, if rightly taken. Henry V. No, if rightly taken, halter. [Re-enter
FALSTAFF] Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone. How now, my sweet
creature of bombast! How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own
knee? Falstaff. My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was not
an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring:
a plague of sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a bladder. There's
villanous news abroad: here was Sir John Bracy from your father; you must
to the court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the north, Percy,
and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold
and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook—what
a plague call you him? Edward Poins. O, Glendower. Falstaff. Owen, Owen,
the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer, and old Northumberland, and that
sprightly Scot of Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill perpendicular,—
Henry V. He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow
flying. Falstaff. You have hit it. Henry V. So did he never the sparrow.
Falstaff. Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run. Henry
V. Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for running! Falstaff.
O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot. Henry V. Yes,
Jack, upon instinct. Falstaff. I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there
too, and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more: Worcester is stolen
away to-night; thy father's beard is turned white with the news: you may
buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel. Henry V. Why, then, it is like,
if there come a hot June and this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds. Falstaff. By the mass, lad, thou
sayest true; it is like we shall have good trading that way. But tell me,
Hal, art not thou horrible afeard? thou being heir-apparent, could the
world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid? doth
not thy blood thrill at it? Henry V. Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some
of thy instinct. Falstaff. Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when
thou comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer. Henry V.
Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the particulars of my
life. Falstaff. Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state, this dagger
my sceptre, and this cushion my crown. Henry V. Thy state is taken for
a joined-stool, thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious
rich crown for a pitiful bald crown! Falstaff. Well, an the fire of grace
be not quite out of thee, now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack
to make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have wept; for I must
speak in passion, and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein. Henry V. Ned,
prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.
Edward Poins. Where hast been, Hal? Henry V. With three or four loggerheads
amongst three or four score hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string
of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers; and can
call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They
take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but the prince of
Wales, yet I am king of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy, by the Lord,
so they call me, and when I am king of England, I shall command all the
good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet; and when
you breathe in your watering, they cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off.
To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that
I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell
thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour, that thou wert not with me in this
sweet action. But, sweet Ned,—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee
this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into my hand by an under-skinker,
one that never spake other English in his life than 'Eight shillings and
sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon,
sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to drive
away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do thou stand in some by-room,
while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale to me may be nothing
but 'Anon.' Step aside, and I'll show thee a precedent. Edward Poins. Francis!
Henry V. Thou art perfect. Edward Poins. Francis! [Exit POINS] [Enter FRANCIS]
Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph. Henry V.
Come hither, Francis. Francis. My lord? Henry V. How long hast thou to
serve, Francis? Francis. Forsooth, five years, and as much as to— Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Five year!
by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking of pewter. But, Francis, darest
thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
a fair pair of heels and run from it? Francis. O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn
upon all the books in England, I could find in my heart. Edward Poins.
[Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Henry V. How old art thou, Francis?
Francis. Let me see—about Michaelmas next I shall be— Edward Poins. [Within]
Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord. Henry V. Nay,
but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou gavest me,'twas a pennyworth,
wast't not? Francis. O Lord, I would it had been two! Henry V. I will give
thee for it a thousand pound: ask me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have
it. Edward Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon. Henry V. Anon,
Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; or, Francis, o' Thursday;
or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But, Francis! Francis. My lord? Henry
V. Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button, not-pated, agate-ring,
puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,— Francis. O
Lord, sir, who do you mean? Henry V. Why, then, your brown bastard is your
only drink; for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully:
in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much. Francis. What, sir? Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Henry V. Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them
call? [Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed, not knowing which
way to go] [Enter Vintner] Vintner. What, standest thou still, and hearest
such a calling? Look to the guests within. [Exit Francis] My lord, old
Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are at the door: shall I let them in?
Henry V. Let them alone awhile, and then open the door. [Exit Vintner]
Poins! [Re-enter POINS] Edward Poins. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Sirrah,
Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the door: shall we be merry?
Edward Poins. As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what cunning match
have you made with this jest of the drawer? come, what's the issue? Henry
V. I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours since the
old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve o'clock
at midnight. [Re-enter FRANCIS] What's o'clock, Francis? Francis. Anon,
anon, sir. [Exit] Henry V. That ever this fellow should have fewer words
than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is upstairs and
downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's
mind, the Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or seven dozen
of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon
this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she, 'how many
hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he; and answers
'Some fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I prithee, call in
Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer
his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow. [Enter
FALSTAFF, Gadshill, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following with wine] Edward
Poins. Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been? Falstaff. A plague of all cowards,
I say, and a vengeance too! marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy.
Ere I lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend them and foot
them too. A plague of all cowards! Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there
no virtue extant? [He drinks] Henry V. Didst thou never see Titan kiss
a dish of butter? pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound. Falstaff. You rogue,
here's lime in this sack too: there is nothing but roguery to be found
in villanous man: yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in
it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack; die when thou wilt, if manhood,
good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a shotten
herring. There live not three good men unhanged in England; and one of
them is fat and grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say. I would
I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any thing. A plague of all cowards,
I say still. Henry V. How now, wool-sack! what mutter you? Falstaff. A
king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath,
and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese, I'll
never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales! Henry V. Why, you
whoreson round man, what's the matter? Falstaff. Are not you a coward?
answer me to that: and Poins there? Edward Poins. 'Zounds, ye fat paunch,
an ye call me coward, by the Lord, I'll stab thee. Falstaff. I call thee
coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call thee coward: but I would give a
thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough
in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back: call you that backing
of your friends? A plague upon such backing! give me them that will face
me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I drunk to-day. Henry V. O
villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last. Falstaff.
All's one for that. [He drinks] A plague of all cowards, still say I. Henry
V. What's the matter? Falstaff. What's the matter! there be four of us
here have ta'en a thousand pound this day morning. Henry V. Where is it,
Jack? where is it? Falstaff. Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred
upon poor four of us. Henry V. What, a hundred, man? Falstaff. I am a rogue,
if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two hours together. I
have 'scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four
through the hose; my buckler cut through and through; my sword hacked like
a hand-saw—ecce signum! I never dealt better since I was a man: all would
not do. A plague of all cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness. Henry V. Speak,
sirs; how was it? Gadshill. We four set upon some dozen— Falstaff. Sixteen
at least, my lord. Gadshill. And bound them. Peto. No, no, they were not
bound. Falstaff. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I am
a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew. Gadshill. As we were sharing, some six or seven
fresh men set upon us— Falstaff. And unbound the rest, and then come in
the other. Henry V. What, fought you with them all? Falstaff. All! I know
not what you call all; but if I fought not with fifty of them, I am a bunch
of radish: if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack,
then am I no two-legged creature. Henry V. Pray God you have not murdered
some of them. Falstaff. Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell
thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in
buckram let drive at me— Henry V. What, four? thou saidst but two even
now. Falstaff. Four, Hal; I told thee four. Edward Poins. Ay, ay, he said
four. Falstaff. These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at me. I
made me no more ado but took all their seven points in my target, thus.
Henry V. Seven? why, there were but four even now. Falstaff. In buckram?
Edward Poins. Ay, four, in buckram suits. Falstaff. Seven, by these hilts,
or I am a villain else. Henry V. Prithee, let him alone; we shall have
more anon. Falstaff. Dost thou hear me, Hal? Henry V. Ay, and mark thee
too, Jack. Falstaff. Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
in buckram that I told thee of— Henry V. So, two more already. Falstaff.
Their points being broken,— Edward Poins. Down fell their hose. Falstaff.
Began to give me ground: but I followed me close, came in foot and hand;
and with a thought seven of the eleven I paid. Henry V. O monstrous! eleven
buckram men grown out of two! Falstaff. But, as the devil would have it,
three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand. Henry
V. These lies are like their father that begets them; gross as a mountain,
open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,— Falstaff. What, art thou mad?
art thou mad? is not the truth the truth? Henry V. Why, how couldst thou
know these men in Kendal green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see
thy hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this? Edward Poins.
Come, your reason, Jack, your reason. Falstaff. What, upon compulsion?
'Zounds, an I were at the strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion! If reasons
were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion,
I. Henry V. I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine coward,
this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker, this huge hill of flesh,— Falstaff.
'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried neat's tongue, you bull's
pizzle, you stock-fish! O for breath to utter what is like thee! you tailor's-yard,
you sheath, you bowcase; you vile standing-tuck,— Henry V. Well, breathe
awhile, and then to it again: and when thou hast tired thyself in base
comparisons, hear me speak but this. Edward Poins. Mark, Jack. Henry V.
We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and were masters of their
wealth. Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down. Then did we two
set on you four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your prize, and have
it; yea, and can show it you here in the house: and, Falstaff, you carried
your guts away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy
and still run and roared, as ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou,
to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight! What
trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst thou now find out to hide
thee from this open and apparent shame? Edward Poins. Come, let's hear,
Jack; what trick hast thou now? Falstaff. By the Lord, I knew ye as well
as he that made ye. Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince? why, thou knowest I
am as valiant as Hercules: but beware instinct; the lion will not touch
the true prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a coward on instinct.
I shall think the better of myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you
have the money. Hostess, clap to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship
come to you! What, shall we be merry? shall we have a play extempore? Henry
V. Content; and the argument shall be thy running away. Falstaff. Ah, no
more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me! [Enter Hostess] Hostess Quickly.
O Jesu, my lord the prince! Henry V. How now, my lady the hostess! what
sayest thou to me? Hostess Quickly. Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman
of the court at door would speak with you: he says he comes from your father.
Henry V. Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him back
again to my mother. Falstaff. What manner of man is he? Hostess Quickly.
An old man. Falstaff. What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
I give him his answer? Henry V. Prithee, do, Jack. Falstaff. 'Faith, and
I'll send him packing. [Exit FALSTAFF] Henry V. Now, sirs: by'r lady, you
fought fair; so did you, Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too,
you ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true prince; no, fie!
Lord Bardolph. 'Faith, I ran when I saw others run. Henry V. 'Faith, tell
me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's sword so hacked? Peto. Why, he hacked
it with his dagger, and said he would swear truth out of England but he
would make you believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the
like. Lord Bardolph. Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to make
them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was
the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
to hear his monstrous devices. Henry V. O villain, thou stolest a cup of
sack eighteen years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and
yet thou rannest away: what instinct hadst thou for it? Lord Bardolph.
My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold these exhalations? Henry
V. I do. Lord Bardolph. What think you they portend? Henry V. Hot livers
and cold purses. Lord Bardolph. Choler, my lord, if rightly taken. Henry
V. No, if rightly taken, halter. [Re-enter FALSTAFF] Here comes lean Jack,
here comes bare-bone. How now, my sweet creature of bombast! How long is't
ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee? Falstaff. My own knee! when
I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle's talon in the waist; I
could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of sighing and
grief! it blows a man up like a bladder. There's villanous news abroad:
here was Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the court in the
morning. That same mad fellow of the north, Percy, and he of Wales, that
gave Amamon the bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the devil
his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook—what a plague call you
him? Edward Poins. O, Glendower. Falstaff. Owen, Owen, the same; and his
son-in-law Mortimer, and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill perpendicular,— Henry
V. He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying.
Falstaff. You have hit it. Henry V. So did he never the sparrow. Falstaff.
Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run. Henry V. Why,
what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for running! Falstaff. O'
horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot. Henry V. Yes,
Jack, upon instinct. Falstaff. I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there
too, and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more: Worcester is stolen
away to-night; thy father's beard is turned white with the news: you may
buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel. Henry V. Why, then, it is like,
if there come a hot June and this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds. Falstaff. By the mass, lad, thou
sayest true; it is like we shall have good trading that way. But tell me,
Hal, art not thou horrible afeard? thou being heir-apparent, could the
world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid? doth
not thy blood thrill at it? Henry V. Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some
of thy instinct. Falstaff. Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when
thou comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer. Henry V.
Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the particulars of my
life. Falstaff. Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state, this dagger
my sceptre, and this cushion my crown. Henry V. Thy state is taken for
a joined-stool, thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious
rich crown for a pitiful bald crown! Falstaff. Well, an the fire of grace
be not quite out of thee, now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack
to make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have wept; for I must
speak in passion, and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein. Henry V. Ned,
prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.
Edward Poins. Where hast been, Hal? Henry V. With three or four loggerheads
amongst three or four score hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string
of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers; and can
call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They
take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but the prince of
Wales, yet I am king of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy, by the Lord,
so they call me, and when I am king of England, I shall command all the
good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet; and when
you breathe in your watering, they cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off.
To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that
I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell
thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour, that thou wert not with me in this
sweet action. But, sweet Ned,—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee
this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into my hand by an under-skinker,
one that never spake other English in his life than 'Eight shillings and
sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon,
sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to drive
away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do thou stand in some by-room,
while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale to me may be nothing
but 'Anon.' Step aside, and I'll show thee a precedent. Edward Poins. Francis!
Henry V. Thou art perfect. Edward Poins. Francis! [Exit POINS] [Enter FRANCIS]
Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph. Henry V.
Come hither, Francis. Francis. My lord? Henry V. How long hast thou to
serve, Francis? Francis. Forsooth, five years, and as much as to— Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Five year!
by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking of pewter. But, Francis, darest
thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
a fair pair of heels and run from it? Francis. O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn
upon all the books in England, I could find in my heart. Edward Poins.
[Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Henry V. How old art thou, Francis?
Francis. Let me see—about Michaelmas next I shall be— Edward Poins. [Within]
Francis! Francis. Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord. Henry V. Nay,
but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou gavest me,'twas a pennyworth,
wast't not? Francis. O Lord, I would it had been two! Henry V. I will give
thee for it a thousand pound: ask me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have
it. Edward Poins. [Within] Francis! Francis. Anon, anon. Henry V. Anon,
Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; or, Francis, o' Thursday;
or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But, Francis! Francis. My lord? Henry
V. Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button, not-pated, agate-ring,
puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,— Francis. O
Lord, sir, who do you mean? Henry V. Why, then, your brown bastard is your
only drink; for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully:
in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much. Francis. What, sir? Edward
Poins. [Within] Francis! Henry V. Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them
call? [Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed, not knowing which
way to go] [Enter Vintner] Vintner. What, standest thou still, and hearest
such a calling? Look to the guests within. [Exit Francis] My lord, old
Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are at the door: shall I let them in?
Henry V. Let them alone awhile, and then open the door. [Exit Vintner]
Poins! [Re-enter POINS] Edward Poins. Anon, anon, sir. Henry V. Sirrah,
Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the door: shall we be merry?
Edward Poins. As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what cunning match
have you made with this jest of the drawer? come, what's the issue? Henry
V. I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours since the
old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve o'clock
at midnight. [Re-enter FRANCIS] What's o'clock, Francis? Francis. Anon,
anon, sir. [Exit] Henry V. That ever this fellow should have fewer words
than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is upstairs and
downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's
mind, the Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or seven dozen
of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon
this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she, 'how many
hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he; and answers
'Some fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I prithee, call in
Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer
his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow. [Enter
FALSTAFF, Gadshill, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following with wine] Edward
Poins. Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been? Falstaff. A plague of all cowards,
I say, and a vengeance too! marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy.
Ere I lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend them and foot
them too. A plague of all cowards! Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there
no virtue extant? [He drinks] Henry V. Didst thou never see Titan kiss
a dish of butter? pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound. Falstaff. You rogue,
here's lime in this sack too: there is nothing but roguery to be found
in villanous man: yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in
it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack; die when thou wilt, if manhood,
good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a shotten
herring. There live not three good men unhanged in England; and one of
them is fat and grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say. I would
I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any thing. A plague of all cowards,
I say still. Henry V. How now, wool-sack! what mutter you? Falstaff. A
king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath,
and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese, I'll
never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales! Henry V. Why, you
whoreson round man, what's the matter? Falstaff. Are not you a coward?
answer me to that: and Poins there? Edward Poins. 'Zounds, ye fat paunch,
an ye call me coward, by the Lord, I'll stab thee. Falstaff. I call thee
coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call thee coward: but I would give a
thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough
in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back: call you that backing
of your friends? A plague upon such backing! give me them that will face
me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I drunk to-day. Henry V. O
villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last. Falstaff.
All's one for that. [He drinks] A plague of all cowards, still say I. Henry
V. What's the matter? Falstaff. What's the matter! there be four of us
here have ta'en a thousand pound this day morning. Henry V. Where is it,
Jack? where is it? Falstaff. Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred
upon poor four of us. Henry V. What, a hundred, man? Falstaff. I am a rogue,
if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two hours together. I
have 'scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four
through the hose; my buckler cut through and through; my sword hacked like
a hand-saw—ecce signum! I never dealt better since I was a man: all would
not do. A plague of all cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness. Henry V. Speak,
sirs; how was it? Gadshill. We four set upon some dozen— Falstaff. Sixteen
at least, my lord. Gadshill. And bound them. Peto. No, no, they were not
bound. Falstaff. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I am
a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew. Gadshill. As we were sharing, some six or seven
fresh men set upon us— Falstaff. And unbound the rest, and then come in
the other. Henry V. What, fought you with them all? Falstaff. All! I know
not what you call all; but if I fought not with fifty of them, I am a bunch
of radish: if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack,
then am I no two-legged creature. Henry V. Pray God you have not murdered
some of them. Falstaff. Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell
thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in
buckram let drive at me— Henry V. What, four? thou saidst but two even
now. Falstaff. Four, Hal; I told thee four.
